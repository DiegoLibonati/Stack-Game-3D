## Description

In this page I replicated without gravity the famous mobile game "Stack Game", which consists of stacking blocks one on top of the other. In case of stacking with a block that is not perfectly superimposed to the one below, the block above will lose the part that was not stacked correctly. The game ends when a block is not stacked correctly. To stack you will have to click.
